# January 30th: Milestone #6

# KORA App is Live! ðŸš€

Weâ€™re excited to share that **KORA is now fully deployed** and accessible online 24/7! This milestone marks a major step in making our AI-powered education platform available to students and institutions.

## 1. Backend Deployment & Cloud Hosting

To ensure a **scalable and reliable infrastructure**, we chose **Digital Ocean** for our backend deployment. This allows us to provide **secure, high-performance APIs** that power KORAâ€™s features.

- **Deployed backend server** with full HTTPS support.
- **Scalable infrastructure** to handle increasing user demand.
- **Improved reliability** with cloud-based hosting.

## 2. Frontend & Backend Integration

With the backend live, we updated the **KORA frontend** to connect directly to the deployed API, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

- **Live deployment at [kora.ac](https://kora.ac).**
- **Full integration with backend APIs** for real-time interactions.
- **End-to-end testing** to ensure stability across all features.

These updates allow students and educators to access KORA from anywhere, with **faster response times and a more reliable system**.
