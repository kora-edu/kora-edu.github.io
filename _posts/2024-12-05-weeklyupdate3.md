### Weekly Update: Major Milestones!

Here’s what we accomplished this week:  

---

#### **1. Exam Generation Page and UI Refactoring**  
*Kahu* developed the **Exam Generation Page**, which allows students to create exams tailored to their needs. Alongside this, he refactored all other pages on the site to ensure a consistent look and feel.  

- **Responsive Design Fix:** The site was also updated to work smoothly across all screen sizes. [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hJ73RzTt1BE).  
- **Exam Generation Demo:** [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMWb4fhtdw).

#### **2. Programming IDE Development**  
*Kahu* developed a **browser-based programming interface (IDE)** that integrates programming question generation. This serverless IDE now supports:  
- **Question generation** through the **VAST AI Qwen Coder endpoint**.  
- **Test case execution**, with clear pass/fail indicators for students.  

Here’s what it looks like in action:
