### Weekly Update: Key Progress & Enhancements  

Hereâ€™s a roundup of the major accomplishments this week:

---

#### **1. LTI Integration and Framework Completion**  
We successfully implemented **LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)** for seamless authentication and integration with external learning management systems.  

- The **LTI framework** is now complete, enabling smooth collaboration with platforms that support LTI standards.  

---

#### **2. Enhanced Text and Knowledge Generation**  
Significant improvements were made in text and knowledge-based workflows:  

- **Text Generation**: Streamlined and enhanced for better performance and reliability.  
- **Knowledge Graph Generation (KG-RAG)**: Developed a robust system for generating knowledge graphs from ingested documents, enabling deeper contextual insights.  
- **Optimized Embeddings**: Introduced separate embedding models for efficiency:  
  - **nomic-embed-text-v1.5** for embedding.  
  - **bge-reranker-v2-m3** for re-ranking lookups in the vector database, improving query accuracy.  

---

#### **3. Hatchet Dashboard Deployment**  
We launched the **Hatchet Dashboard**, a powerful admin tool that provides a detailed view of requests and workflows.  

- Admins can now monitor, analyze, and manage data pipelines efficiently, ensuring smoother operations across the platform.  

---

#### **4. Q/A and RAG Agent Integration**  
The platform now supports:  

- **Question-Answering (Q/A)**: Accurate responses generated from ingested documents.  
- **RAG Agent Responses**: Integrated retrieval-augmented generation for improved results in document-based queries.

#### **5. kora.ac Full Supabase Integration**  
The **kora.ac platform** is now fully integrated with **Supabase**, featuring:  

- **Rate Limiting**: Ensuring fair and efficient resource usage.  
- **Security Enhancements**: Comprehensive protections against potential exploits.  

---

#### **6. Comprehensive Testing**  
Testing milestones achieved:  

- **LTI Integration Tests**: Complete coverage using Jest, ensuring reliability across integrations.  
- **tryKORA Tests**: Full Jest test coverage, including:  
  - **API Rate Limits**  
  - **Database operations**  
  - **Security and Exploit Testing**  
  - **Codebase Logic (e.g., parsing, utils, helper functions)**
