# November 18th: Milestone 2

We’re excited to share that **Milestone 2** has been successfully completed! Building on the foundation from Milestone 1, we’ve focused on integrating with existing educational tools and improving the AI model.

### Achievements:
- **Frontend:**
  - Implemented an **LTI plugin framework** to integrate KORA Edu with popular learning platforms like **Canvas** and **Moodle**.

- **Backend:**
  - Completed a **second fine-tune** of our AI model, leveraging JBdata5 to enhance question recognition and generation capabilities.
  - Developed functionality to convert text-based questions into formatted exam papers, making it easier for educators to use.

With this milestone, we’re one step closer to providing an intuitive and powerful platform for educators and students alike. Keep an eye out for our next update as we tackle Milestone 3!
